## Project Description
We aim at reducing wastes while maintaining the consumer culture. People should be able to sell/buy, or exchange goods that they are not using anymore. This way, they can gain some income while preserving the environment. QuickSale is an online marketplace allowing users to buy, sell, or even exchange secondhand items (shoes, clothes, electronics e.t.c.)  in the comfort of their respective homes.  Anyone can become a seller as long as they register.  For instance, a user uploads an accurate picture of the items he/she wants to sell. Afterward, the article will be added to the available products. All payments and checkouts are performed directly from the application. On the other hand, sellers will be responsible for the delivery services and other related miscellaneous.

## Functionalities
These are the implemented features within the app:
- [x] **On-boarding:** The app comes with several onboarding screens. These screens contain a quick guide overview of the app use cases.
- [x] **Email Authentication:** All users must either log in or signup to access the app by entering their email and password.
- [x] **Custom Profile:** When a user is authenticated, they can update their personal information. Users can replace their profile picture by either choosing an image from their device or capturing a new profile picture with the camera. 
- [x] **Notifications:** Users can receive notifications on their phones. They will receive notifications when they access the app at the start, signup, and login.
- [x] **Sell or Buy items:** Users can sell items by adding a product from their profile page. They can also buy any items from the Discover Page where all the products are displayed. 
- [x] **Favorites & Order History:** Users can add a product to their favorites section. Once a successful purchase is made, the record is saved in the order history section to track previous purchases.
